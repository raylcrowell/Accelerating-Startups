# Accelerating-Startups

Approach the challenge of venture development by breaking the norms of entrepreneurial education and networking, avoiding lecture-based instruction and the reliance of outside mentors, to carry the bulk of knowledge transfer. 

Use a rigorous stage-defensibility screening process to select entrepreneurs, startups, and enterprise teams in order to elevate top performers while maintaining steady growth of talented workforce equipped for next generation digital opportunities.

Provide a suite of carefully curated and sequenced workshops, roundtables, social hangs, and problem/solution hacks focusing on developing skills for emerging technology traction roles, incubating and testing the best ideas, accelerating solutions to problems worth solving, commercializing technologies that improve lives, and cultivating ecosystems to thrive in uncertain and quickly evolving times.
